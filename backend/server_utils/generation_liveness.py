"""Proof-of-life file for local generation, read by Electron's liveness monitor.

A local generation can hold the Python GIL for long, uninterrupted stretches
(MPS model builds release it far less eagerly than CUDA inference), which
starves the asyncio event loop that serves ``/health`` — the backend isn't
hung, it's just busy, but the HTTP liveness probe can't tell the difference
and would otherwise SIGTERM it mid-generation. While any ``liveness_hold``
is open, a daemon thread refreshes ``generation-heartbeat.json`` under
``LTX_APP_DATA_DIR`` every interval; Electron skips the kill while the file
is fresh and carries the backend's pid. Refcounted: overlapping holds
(video + remote queue runners in one process) share one writer, and the
file is removed only when the last hold exits, so a hung backend with no
live generation still fails the probe and restarts.

Writes are atomic (temp file + rename): a torn read parses as missing and
would drop the grace mid-stall. Telemetry must never break generation, so
every filesystem failure is swallowed to a debug log. Without
``LTX_APP_DATA_DIR`` (unit tests, headless runs) the hold is a no-op.
